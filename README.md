## A little about yourself
I got my associates in business admin from Community College
in New Jersey. I switched my major to Computer Science after my second
semester at New Paltz. I enrolled in New Paltz because it was the only school close enough
to my house that had a late registration date. I am the Vice President of the Eleet Coders
club along with being the President of CS Teams here on campus and I am the liaison for
the Google Developer Group that was established here over the winter break

### A Paragraph about your computer experience. Include your undergrad major, any computer courses you've taken, any programs you've written, any projects you've collaborated on.
I have always been interested in computers since I was a child. I have completed Harvard
cs50 which led me to enjoy computer science. I am in the process of working through
Freecodecamp and the odin project’s curriculum to further my studies in web
development as that is what I enjoy the most. My undergrad major is computer science;
I’ve taken all the pre-req courses as I am now working through the major. I am currently
taking Language processing, operating systems, software engineering, calculus 1 and of
course, this class. I’ve written a few programs within my spare time, such as a simple
program that pulls the MTA subway data using GTFS data to give me a list of all the subway
line’s departures and arrivals. I’ve also written a stock market CLI that imitates the stock
market with price movements and portfolio management. I have not collaborated on any
projects so far, but I’d like to do that more once I feel I am able to contribute more and use
what I’ve learned through this class

#### A Paragraph about how you see yourself using what we learn in this course
I am very interested in web development and looking forward to learning more about it with
this class. I have been told by many people that this is the best computer science course
on campus and was very happy to get a seat in it. I am very excited to learn more about web
dev through your course to see what I will be able to do during and after the course
